[Live Link Would be Here]

## Background and Overview
Chess is an 8 x 8 board game that consists of 16 pieces on both sides. It's a fun game since there are 6 unique pieces each player has with unique rules for each piece. Thus, the likelihood of two games being alike is nil.

##  Functionality and MVP Features
* Users can click on a piece and a highlight of all the  possible positions that pieces can go will be highlighted.
* Game ends when a King is in a checkmate  or there is a stalemate.
* If a piece moves to a spot another piece (of opposite color) is on, that piece will be removed from the game.
